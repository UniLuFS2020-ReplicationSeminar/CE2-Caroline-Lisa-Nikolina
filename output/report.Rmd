# Report

We were interested in the relevance of OpenAI in media. We wanted to analyse in which sections this topic came up the most, which words were most prevalent and if the sentiment around it was positive or negative.

## Collecting the Data

We created a developer account to be able to access the data from the Guardian API. Then we retrieved the data with a GET request and parsed it to extract the relevant information. We ended up with a tibble of 2390 articles, because it failed to fetch data for page 240 and onward. These were sorted by relevancy.

## Analysis 

### Plot 

We created a plot to show the amount of articles that were published in each section using a bar plot to showcase the distribution. It became apparent that the most popular sections were "Technology", "Sport", "Opinion", "World news", "Business" and interestingly "Australia news" significantly above "US news" in descending order.

### Word cloud

Next a word cloud seemed to be a good option to display the most frequent words in these articles. Among others some prevalent words were "open", "happened", "review", "australian", "new", "first". More highlighted words were also "french", "gaza", "tech", "warns" and "intelligence".

### Sentiment analysis

Finally, we analysed the general sentiment by defining positive ("win", "intelligence", "best", ...) and negative ("threat", "risk", "abuse", ...) through the bing lexicon to rate each article.
