# Report----
## Topic------
We were interested in the relevance of OpenAI in
media and specifically The Guardian. We wanted to analyse in which sections this
topic came up the most and how many articles were written about it across time. 
## Collecting the Data-------
We created a developer account to be able to access the data from the API. Then 
we retrieved the data with a GET request and parsed it to extract the relevant 
information. We ended up with a tibble of 2390 articles, because it failed to 
fetch data for page 240 and onward. These were sorted by relevancy.
## Analysis------
First we created a bar plot to represent the amount of articles in each section of the newspaper. We found that the topic was most relevant in the Technology, Sport, Opinion, World news and business sections.
