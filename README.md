Hi there,

We are three master students at the University of Lucerne. For our course "Data Mining for Political and Social Sciences using R" we have to do a class exercise where we need to use the The Guardian API to get data. We are planning to use the API to get data about the most popular articles about Open AI. 

More about our project can be found in the report in the output folder. 
In the Data folder you find our data and in the Scripts folder you find our code.

We hope you enjoy our project. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact us.

Best regards,
Caroline, Lisa & Nikolina
